2D Platformer Exam Round II :

Small Platformer Game made in 6 hours (actually 7 for bug fixing),
in which I had to recreate a custom Rigidbody with collisions, physics and gravity.

Controls :

Q / D -> Movement
Z or Space -> Jump / Double Jump
Left Click or Left Shift -> Shoot

Known Bugs :

No apparent bugs. But the Custom Rigidbody and raycasts can sometimes break the game.
Should not be occuring in the current version nonetheless.
